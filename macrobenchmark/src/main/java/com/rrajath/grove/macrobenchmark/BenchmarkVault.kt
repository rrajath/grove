/**
 * Shared setup for every benchmark in this module: which package to measure and
 * how to launch :app straight into a populated Notebooks screen with no SAF
 * folder picker and no onboarding.
 *
 * The `benchmark` build type of :app carries `BuildConfig.TEST_HOOKS = true`, so
 * `MainActivity` honours these launch-intent extras (see
 * `com.rrajath.grove.debug.DebugTestVault` in the app module):
 *
 *  - `grove_test_direct_vault` — point the vault at an app-owned directory
 *  - `grove_test_seed`         — (re)seed it from the bundled `.org` fixtures
 *  - `grove_test_vault_size`   — instead of the fixtures, generate N synthetic
 *                                notebooks plus one large outline, for scroll tests
