/**
 * Canonical `.org` sample content shared by every test layer (integration,
 * UI, Maestro, benchmark). Keep these small and stable — assertions elsewhere
 * pin their exact text (e.g. the unique word "photosynthesis" in
 * [READING_LIST], the `capture-inbox` CUSTOM_ID in [INBOX]).
 *
 * The bodies live as resource files under `src/testFixtures/resources/fixtures/`
 * so there is a single source of truth: this object reads them off the test
 * classpath, and the debug build copies the same directory into its APK assets
 * (`copyDebugTestFixtures` in `app/build.gradle.kts`) so the Maestro debug-vault
 * hook seeds from identical content. See internal/test-suite-03-e2e-maestro.md.
