/**
 * Host for a reminder notification's "Reschedule" action.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* a route inside `MainActivity`: rescheduling from the shade
 * is a one-shot errand started from whatever app the user was in, and it has to
 * end back there. Routing it through the main task landed the user in the editor
 * afterwards, and finishing that task instead would have torn down wherever they
 * had been in Grove. This activity declares an empty `taskAffinity`, so it opens
 * in a task of its own: picking dates and confirming closes it, the app
 * underneath comes back, and Grove's own task is never touched.
 *
 * The write is headless in the same sense as `ReminderActionReceiver`'s
 * "Complete" — re-read the file, re-locate the heading by its stored composite
 * key, mutate, save, sync — and runs on [GroveApplication.appScope] rather than
 * any activity-scoped scope, so finishing the moment the user taps Apply cannot
 * cancel a write that is still in flight.
