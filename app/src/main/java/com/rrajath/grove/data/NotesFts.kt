/**
 * The FTS5 mirror of the searchable text in the `notes` table.
 *
 * Room's annotations only cover FTS3/FTS4, and FTS4 has no `trigram` tokenizer —
 * which Grove needs, because its documented text semantics are arbitrary
 * case-insensitive *substring* matching (`meet` matches `committee`), not token
 * or prefix matching. So the virtual table is created by hand here and read via
 * `@RawQuery`; its writes live in [IndexDao] behind `@SkipQueryVerification` and
 * are co-transacted with the `notes` writes by [GroveDatabase] so the two tables
 * can never drift.
 *
 * The index is a candidate *narrower* only: `QueryMatcher` still decides every
 * final match, so an FTS hit that the Kotlin matcher rejects costs nothing but a
 * row. That also means the table is entirely optional — see [create].
