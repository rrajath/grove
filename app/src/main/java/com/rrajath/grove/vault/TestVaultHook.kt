 * Debug-only escape hatch that points the vault at a plain app-owned directory
 * instead of a Storage Access Framework tree, so instrumentation and Maestro can
 * get a populated vault with no system folder picker and no runtime permission.
 *
 * Only `debug.DebugTestVault` calls [useDirectory], from a `MainActivity`
 * launch-intent extra, and only when `BuildConfig.TEST_HOOKS` is on (`debug` +
 * the benchmark variants). In a release build R8 dead-strips that path, so
 * [root] stays `null` for the life of the process and
 * [com.rrajath.grove.GroveApplication.fileStore] behaves exactly as before.
