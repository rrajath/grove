/**
 * Pure logic (no Android imports, JVM-testable) for the daily reminder digest
 * ("You have X tasks due today"), fired at the default reminder time.
 *
 * X must agree with what the Agenda screen shows for today (overdue + due
 * today), so this mirrors its rule: a heading belongs to exactly one day, its
 * SCHEDULED date if it has one, otherwise its DEADLINE. A heading carrying
 * both a SCHEDULED and a DEADLINE reminder is therefore collapsed to one task
 * here too, even though the reminders table tracks them as two distinct rows.
 * Bare active timestamps are the exception: they are events, counted per stamp
 * on their own date and never collapsed into a heading's task anchor.
